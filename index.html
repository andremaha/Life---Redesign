			 			<h3>Living is easy with eyes closed</h3>
						<p>
							I often say to my friends that my life has been perfect sice about 2005. Not mediocre, 
							but perfect - the way that I even think 	sometimes - Wow, it is just to perfect to be true.  
						</p>
						<p>
							I think I know why it happened - but there is no way to give a one sentence formula. 
							So I decided to take a deductive approache and just show how it is possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							Working as a designer I get to have an idea, think about it and then form it into the visible object. 
							I believe that applies to everything in this world - you just get the vision and then you make it real - you design your life.
