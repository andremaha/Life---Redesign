		 			<h3>Living is easy with eyes closed</h3>
					<p>
						I often say to my friends that my life has been perfect sice about 2005. Not mediocre, 
						but perfect - the way that I even think 	sometimes - Wow, it is just to perfect to be true.  
					</p>
					<p>
						I think I know why it happened - but there is no way to give a one sentence formula. 
						So I decided to take a deductive approache and just show how it is possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Working as a designer I get to have an idea, think about it and then form it into the visible object. 
						I believe that applies to everything in this world - you just get the vision and then you make it real - you design your life.
